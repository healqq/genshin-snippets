# Dropping crit rate with Royal weapon
Also calculated expected crit multiplier difference between two setups:
- any atk% weapon + crit rate head artifact(26% crit rate)
- Royal weapon + crit damage head artifact(57% crit damage)

Red = setup with Royal is better. On Z axis difference in crit multiplier is noted.
